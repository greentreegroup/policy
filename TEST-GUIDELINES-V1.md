## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the API testing workflow for the **Data Extraction Service**. The service is designed to extract data from a third-party source. To ensure its reliability, accuracy, and robustness, our testing strategy incorporates two primary types of tests:

* **Seeded Data Tests:** These tests validate the core API behavior and internal logic using pre-populated database entries. This approach removes external dependencies, allowing for rapid, controlled, and deterministic testing of the service's internal mechanisms.
* **Real Extraction Tests:** These tests focus on the end-to-end functionality of the service by interacting with the third-party API in real-time. They utilize valid API tokens to perform actual data extractions, ensuring seamless integration and data fidelity with the external system.

In addition to these functional tests, a dedicated focus on **edge case tests** is crucial. These tests rigorously examine how the service handles invalid inputs, unexpected requests, and "not found" scenarios, thereby guaranteeing the API's resilience and its ability to provide clear, actionable error responses.

This comprehensive testing methodology aims to maintain a high standard of quality for the Data Extraction Service throughout its lifecycle.

## 2. Test Types Overview

The following table provides a high-level overview of the different test types employed in our API testing strategy:

| Test Type                 | Description                                                                                          | Primary Use Case                                                                    |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seeded Data Tests** | Utilizes predefined data inserted directly into the test database for controlled, fast, and isolated tests. | Validating internal API logic, data processing, and business rules without external dependencies. |
| **Real Extraction Tests** | Employs actual API tokens for the service provided to trigger live data extractions, validating real-time integration. | Ensuring end-to-end integration, authentication, and data mapping with the external service provided API. |
| **Edge Case Tests** | Focuses on validating the API's behavior when confronted with invalid inputs, unexpected states, or boundary conditions. | Guaranteeing API robustness, proper error handling, and a predictable response to abnormal scenarios. |

## 3. Workflow Steps for Seeded Data Tests

Seeded data tests are designed to be fast and deterministic, verifying the internal logic of the extraction service.

1.  **Setup Environment and Data**:
    * Initialize a clean test database.
    * Seed the database with pre-defined extraction job records (e.g., pending, completed, cancelled jobs) and mock extracted data associated with these jobs. Ensure data covers various scenarios (e.g., zero records, few records, many records).
2.  **Verify Job Status (`/api/v1/scan/status/<job_id>`)**:
    * Query the status endpoint for a seeded job's unique connection ID.
    * Assert that the returned status matches the pre-seeded state (e.g., `pending`, `completed`).
    * Verify associated metadata like `record_count`, `start_time`, `end_time` if applicable for the seeded state.
3.  **Fetch Extraction Results (`/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`)**:
    * For a seeded *completed* job, retrieve the extraction results.
    * Assert that the returned data matches the pre-seeded mock data in terms of content, format, and quantity.
    * Verify pagination if the seeded data is extensive.
4.  **List All Jobs (`/api/v1/jobs/jobs`)**:
    * Make a `GET` request to list all extraction jobs.
    * Assert that all seeded jobs (including pending, completed, and cancelled ones) appear in the list.
    * Verify pagination and filtering options if available.
5.  **Retrieve Job Statistics (`/api/v1/jobs/statistics`)**:
    * Request overall statistics about extraction jobs.
    * Assert that metrics like total job count, number of completed jobs, and average extraction time accurately reflect the seeded data.
6.  **Health Check (`/api/v1/health`)**:
    * Perform a `GET` request to the health endpoint.
    * Assert that the service reports a healthy status (e.g., `ok`). This confirms basic service availability.
7.  **Cancel a Pending Job (`/api/v1/scan/cancel/<job_id>`)**:
    * Initiate a `POST` request to cancel a pre-seeded *pending* job.
    * Assert a `200 OK` or `202 Accepted` status code.
    * Immediately follow up with a status check for that `job_id` to confirm its status has changed to `cancelled`.
8.  **Remove Job Data (`/api/v1/scan/remove/<job_id>`)**:
    * Send a `DELETE` request to remove extraction data for a seeded job (can be completed or cancelled).
    * Assert a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` status code.
    * Attempt to fetch results or status for the removed `job_id` and expect a `404 Not Found` or appropriate error, confirming data removal.

## 4. Workflow Steps for Real Extraction Tests

Real extraction tests validate the integration with the service provided API and the complete data extraction pipeline.

1.  **Prepare Valid Credentials for the Service Provided**:
    * Ensure a valid API token for the service provided (e.g., Private App Access Token or OAuth token) is available for testing. This token should have the necessary permissions to access data.
    * Consider using a dedicated test account for the service provided to avoid impacting live production data.
2.  **Start New Extraction (`/api/v1/scan/start`)**:
    * Send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/scan/start` endpoint, including the valid API token for the service provided in the request body (or appropriate header).
    * Assert a `202 Accepted` status code, indicating the job has been successfully initiated.
    * Extract the `job_id` from the response.
3.  **Poll Job Status (`/api/v1/scan/status/<job_id>`)**:
    * Implement a polling mechanism (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) to the `/api/v1/scan/status/<job_id>` endpoint using the `job_id` obtained in the previous step.
    * Monitor the `status` field in the response.
    * Continue polling until the status changes to `completed` or `failed`.
    * If the status is `failed`, investigate the error details returned.
4.  **Retrieve Extracted Results (`/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`)**:
    * Once the job status is `completed`, make a `GET` request to `/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`.
    * Assert a `200 OK` status code.
    * Validate that the extracted data in the response body is correctly formatted (e.g., JSON array of records) and contains expected fields (e.g., `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `id_from_service`).
    * Perform data verification: If possible, compare a sample of the extracted data against the actual data in the service provided account using its own API or UI, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
    * Test pagination if the number of records exceeds a single page limit.
5.  **Remove Extraction Data (`/api/v1/scan/remove/<job_id>`)**:
    * After successful verification of results, send a `DELETE` request to `/api/v1/scan/remove/<job_id>` to clean up the test data.
    * Assert a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` status code.
    * Attempt to access `status` or `result` for the `job_id` to confirm it no longer exists (expecting `404 Not Found`).

---

## 5. Common Assertions and Validations

Across both seeded data and real extraction test types, the following assertions and validations are commonly made to ensure the correctness and reliability of the API:

* **HTTP Status Codes**:
    * Validate that response status codes strictly match expected outcomes (e.g., `200 OK` for successful fetches, `202 Accepted` for accepted asynchronous operations like job start, `204 No Content` for successful deletions with no content, `4xx` for client errors, `5xx` for server errors).
* **Job Status Transitions**:
    * For asynchronous operations, verify that job statuses accurately transition through their lifecycle: `pending` -> `in_progress` -> `completed` or `pending` -> `in_progress` -> `cancelled` or `pending` -> `in_progress` -> `failed`.
* **Response Body Content and Structure**:
    * **Data Integrity**: Ensure extracted data contains correct and expected fields (e.g., `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `id_from_service`).
    * **Schema Validation**: Validate that JSON response bodies conform to expected schemas (data types, mandatory fields, nested structures).
    * **Completeness**: For data extraction, verify that the expected number of records is returned, especially when testing specific filtering or criteria.
    * **Correctness**: Cross-reference extracted data with source data (mocked or real data from the service provided) to ensure accuracy.
* **Pagination and Statistics**:
    * Verify that pagination endpoints (`/api/v1/jobs/jobs`, `/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`) correctly return data in chunks, respecting `limit` and `offset` parameters, and providing correct `next` links or total counts.
    * Confirm that statistics endpoints (`/api/v1/jobs/statistics`) return appropriate and accurate summaries of job metrics.
* **Confirmation Messages**:
    * For state-changing operations like job cancellation or removal, assert that response messages or fields explicitly confirm the action's success.
* **Error Message Content**:
    * In negative test cases, assert that error responses contain meaningful, user-friendly, and actionable error messages with relevant details (e.g., "Invalid API token provided," "Job ID not found").
* **Performance (Basic)**:
    * While not full load testing, basic assertions on response times can be included to ensure requests complete within acceptable thresholds, especially for synchronous operations.
* **Health Status**:
    * The health endpoint should consistently return a valid status (e.g., `"status": "ok"`).

## 7. Edge Case Tests

### 7.1. Description

**Edge case tests** are a critical component of our testing strategy. They are designed to rigorously verify how the API behaves when subjected to invalid inputs, unexpected sequences of requests, and scenarios where data is missing or malformed. The primary goal is to ensure the service is robust, resilient, and provides predictable, helpful error responses rather than crashing or returning ambiguous results.

### 7.2. Edge Cases Tested

Here's a list of the edge cases we specifically test:

* **Invalid or Missing API Token**:
    * Attempting to start an extraction with an **empty, malformed, or unauthorized API token** for the service provided (`/api/v1/scan/start`).
    * Expected: `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized` with a clear error message.
* **Non-existent Job ID**:
    * Requesting the status, results, cancellation, or removal of a `job_id` that does not exist (`/api/v1/scan/status/<job_id>`, `/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`, `/api/v1/scan/cancel/<job_id>`, `/api/v1/scan/remove/<job_id>`).
    * Expected: `404 Not Found` with an appropriate message.
* **Accessing Results for an Incomplete Job**:
    * Attempting to retrieve results for a `job_id` that is still `pending` or `in_progress` (`/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>`).
    * Expected: `409 Conflict` or `400 Bad Request` with a message indicating the job isn't completed yet.
* **Cancelling a Completed or Failed Job**:
    * Sending a cancel request for a `job_id` that is already `completed` or `failed` (`/api/v1/scan/cancel/<job_id>`).
    * Expected: `400 Bad Request` or `409 Conflict` with a message stating the job cannot be cancelled in its current state.
* **Concurrent Requests for the Same Extraction**:
    * Initiating multiple `/api/v1/scan/start` requests with the exact same (or highly similar, if de-duplication is in place) parameters for the service provided.
    * Expected: Only one unique job should be created, or subsequent requests should return an existing `job_id` or `409 Conflict` if duplicate prevention is active.
* **Large Data Volumes / Pagination Stress**:
    * Testing the `/api/v1/scan/result/<job_id>` endpoint with a `job_id` that is known to contain a very large number of records.
    * Expected: Correct pagination behavior, consistent data structure across pages, and no timeouts.
* **Service Provided API Downtime/Errors**:
    * (Simulated or actual) scenarios where the external service provided API is unreachable or returns errors during an extraction.
    * Expected: The extraction job should transition to `failed` status, and the `/api/v1/scan/status/<job_id>` endpoint should provide relevant error details.
* **Malformed Request Body**:
    * Sending `POST` requests (e.g., to `/api/v1/scan/start`) with an **invalid JSON format** or **missing mandatory fields** in the request body.
    * Expected: `400 Bad Request` with specific validation error messages.
* **ID Injection/Manipulation Attempts**:
    * Using non-standard characters, excessively long strings, or SQL/NoSQL injection patterns in `job_id` parameters or other input fields.
    * Expected: Proper input validation, leading to `400 Bad Request` or `404 Not Found`, without data corruption or security vulnerabilities.
* **Rate Limiting from the Service Provided**:
    * If the service provided imposes rate limits, test that the extraction service handles these gracefully, potentially by pausing and retrying, rather than failing the job immediately.
    * Expected: Job might take longer or show retries in logs, but eventually completes (if successful), or fails with a specific rate limit error message.

## 8. Generic Guidelines for Effective API Testing of Extraction Services

### 8.1. Understand the API and its Purpose Thoroughly

Before writing any tests, gain a deep understanding of what the API is supposed to do. This includes:

* **Functionality**: What data does it extract? From where? What are the filters or criteria?
* **Inputs & Outputs**: What are the expected request payloads and response structures?
* **Authentication & Authorization**: How is access controlled? What permissions are needed?
* **Error Handling**: What error codes and messages are returned for different scenarios?
* **Dependencies**: What external services does it rely on (e.g., the service provided, databases)?
* **Asynchronous Nature**: For extraction services, jobs are often asynchronous. Understand the lifecycle (start, poll status, retrieve results, cancel, remove).

### 8.2. Define Clear Test Objectives

For each API endpoint and overall service, articulate what you want to achieve with your tests. Examples include:

* Verify successful data extraction.
* Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs.
* Confirm data consistency and integrity.
* Validate performance under expected load (even basic checks).
* Test security aspects (e.g., unauthorized access).

### 8.3. Categorize Your Tests

Group tests into logical categories to manage complexity and improve focus:

* **Positive/Happy Path Tests**: Verify that the API works as expected under normal, valid conditions.
* **Negative/Error Tests**: Confirm the API handles invalid inputs, missing parameters, and incorrect states gracefully, returning appropriate error codes and messages.
* **Edge Case/Boundary Tests**: Push the limits with extreme values, empty inputs, very large data, or specific tricky scenarios.
* **Performance Tests**: (If applicable) Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization under various loads.
* **Security Tests**: Check for vulnerabilities like injection, broken authentication, or unauthorized access.

### 8.4. Design Test Data Strategically

Test data is crucial for extraction services.

* **Seeded Data**: For internal logic validation, use a controlled, local database with predefined data. This makes tests fast and deterministic.
* **Real Data**: For end-to-end integration, use dedicated test accounts in the external service provided. This ensures real-world scenarios are covered.
* **Variety**: Include data sets with:
    * Zero records
    * Minimum expected records
    * Maximum expected records
    * Records with all fields populated
    * Records with optional fields missing
    * Malformed or unexpected data (if testing robustness to source data issues).
* **Data Isolation**: Ensure tests are independent and don't interfere with each other's data.

### 8.5. Prioritize Test Automation

Manual testing of APIs is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automate as much as possible using frameworks like Postman, Newman, Cypress, Playwright, Python with `requests`, or Java with RestAssured.

### 8.6. Implement Robust Assertions and Validations

Don't just check for a `200 OK` status code.

* **Status Codes**: Assert specific HTTP status codes for success and failure.
* **Response Body**: Validate the complete response payload:
    * **Schema**: Ensure it matches the expected JSON/XML structure.
    * **Data Content**: Verify that the extracted data is accurate and complete.
    * **Error Messages**: Confirm that error responses contain helpful details.
* **Headers**: Check for correct content types, caching headers, etc.
* **Database State**: For seeded tests, verify that database changes (e.g., job status updates) occurred as expected.

### 8.7. Handle Dependencies and State

API tests often have dependencies (e.g., a job must be started before its status can be checked).

* **Chaining Requests**: Design tests to chain requests where one action depends on the result of a previous one (e.g., extract `job_id` from a `start` response and use it for `status` or `result` calls).
* **Cleanup**: Implement effective teardown procedures to leave the environment in a clean state after each test or test suite. This prevents test pollution.
* **Mocking/Stubbing**: For external dependencies (like the service provided API during development or unit testing), use mocks or stubs to isolate the service under test and ensure deterministic results.

### 8.8. Focus on Observability and Logging

* **Meaningful Logs**: Ensure your test framework logs detailed information about requests, responses, and assertions. This is invaluable for debugging failures.
* **Monitoring**: If possible, integrate with monitoring tools to observe the service's behavior during automated test runs.

### 8.9. Documentation and Maintainability

* **Clear Test Cases**: Write test cases that are easy to understand, even for someone who didn't write them.
* **Version Control**: Keep API test code in version control alongside the application code.
* **Regular Updates**: As the API evolves, update tests to reflect changes in functionality, endpoints, or data structures.

### 8.10. Continuous Improvement

* **Integrate with CI/CD**: Run automated API tests as part of your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline to catch regressions early.
* **Analyze Failures**: Don't just rerun failing tests. Investigate the root cause to fix the issue and potentially improve the test or the application.
